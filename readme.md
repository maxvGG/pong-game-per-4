# pong game

this is a pong game that i made in my first in college for a project. 

webpack 6 was used in this project so you may have to download that

1) open terminal in root file location 

2) run the following commands 

   npm install        // install the recuired packages 
   
   npm audit fix      // fixes warning (if shown) 
   
   npm run start      // run game 
   
      (you may have to start your preffered edditor in administrator mode)
   
3) start playing 
   
   the commands are the up and down key on your keyboard (keys used are 38, 40, 32 and 13)
